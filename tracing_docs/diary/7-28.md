Just try to compile the myrocks following the build guide of myrocks repo on github.

Got some build errors .

1. The first is that ZSTD_UNKNOWNxxx not found error.

I solved it by  add the following line 
at `my_compress.cc`

```
# define ZSTD_UNKNOWNxxx=xxx
```


2. `libatmoic not found` error.
I search the issue with keyword `libatomic` and solve this problem by install the
`libatomic-devel`  package in centos 

[issue](https://github.com/facebook/mysql-5.6/issues/1152)



3. `cap_flag_value_t` not defined

Follow the description in the issue post and still get this  libcap  undefined  error. 


Decide to remove the whole repo and git clone it again and see if it works this time.


I have to say that I feel a little bit peer pressure from other interns,

I need to write code too !

I need to run bunch of experiments, now !

I need to create values.
