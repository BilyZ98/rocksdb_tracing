Column format of each trace parser file.
op_time_series : [queryid, access_time(sec), key_id(in this trace)]

block_cache_human_readable_file: 
access_time(in micros), 
block_id, 
block_type, 
block_size, 
column family id,
column family name ,
level,
sst file number
caller ,
no insert,
get id,
get key id ( relative key id),
get referenced data size,
is a cache hit ,
get does get referenced key exists in this block (data block only),
get approximately number of keys in this blocks ,
get table id,
get sequence number,
block key size,
get referenced key size,
block  offset in the SST  file.






Plan : plot three level data in one figure.
Actually not did that , just plotted the single figure.

The x axis is time .
And for the yaxis,  there could be multiple choices, for now I am using latency.

We can also use block_id, file_id, block_cache_hit.
