Column format of each trace parser file.
op_time_series : [queryid, access_time(sec), key_id(in this trace)]

block_cache_human_readable_file: 
[access_time(in micros), block_id, block_type, block_size,  ]


Plan : plot three level data in one figure.
Actually not did that , just plotted the single figure.

The x axis is time .
And for the yaxis,  there could be multiple choices, for now I am using latency.

We can also use block_id, file_id, block_cache_hit.
