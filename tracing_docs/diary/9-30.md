ReadBlockFromFile does not insert the cf_name and sst_id info
into the BlockContents ? 



Two places  call ReadBlockFromFile function 
Both in block_based_table_reader.cc
RetrieveBlock 
  ReadBlockFromFile


ReadMetaIndexBlock
  ReadBlockFromFile


I think I should put the trace info into the block right after
the ReadBlockFromFile function  call
