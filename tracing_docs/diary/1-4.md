After adding lookupCompaction method to the GetEntryFromCache() method , I met the Asserttion `e->next == nullptr` failed error. 

So maybe when entries are took out from the LRU_list the code does no do the pointer clear job. 


Zhichao suggested that I should run the test code that is for the Table lookup or compaction .
