How to add block_cache_tracer into the Cache class:
  Initialize the trace at DBImpl::Open()
  BlockCache is in ColumnFamilyOptions
  So Inject the block_cache_trace into the BlockCache at DBImpl::Open()

  The problem? 
  Can't compile.
  Turn BlockCacheTracer to void * type in cache.h, pass the compile


  Add SetEvoctBlockCacheTracer to Cache class
  Call it at DBImpl to inject the evict_block_cache_tracer




In LRUCacheShard::EvictFromLRU(),
  create BlockCacheTraceRecord and record the cf_name and sst_id to help identify
  the block when block is evicted.
  evict_block_cache_tracer->WriteBlockAccess()


Try to parse the block trace file to see if it work.


Forget to record the block_type in the cached block.
Need this.
We have index block and data block

RetrieveBlock(block_type)
