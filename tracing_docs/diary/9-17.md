Guess I will insert trace info code into the `LRU_Remove` function.



Another thing I am curious about is `table_->Remove(old->key(), old->hash)`



I will add trace in table_->Remove() function


now the problem becomes what block id info do we need to record ? 


```
DBImpl::StartBlockCacheTrace {

  }


```



So what should I do now to put the trace code into the 
`table->Remove()`


I need to come up with a method to identify a block with unique id both in table->Remove and ReadBlockAccess
