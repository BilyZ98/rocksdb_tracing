So I learn how to steart myrocks server 

`
make install 
`

after you compile myrocks successfully.

And now you can test the mysql daemon with the following command 
from the myrocks wiki.

`mysql_install_db --defaults-file=/path/to/my.cnf`

and start mysqld
`mysqld_safe --defaults-file=/path/to/my.cnf`


So what's my next step.

How do I run the mysql bench ?


some bench of mysql must be compiled, let;'s find it.
