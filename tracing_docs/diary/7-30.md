So I learn how to steart myrocks server 

`
make install 
`

after you compile myrocks successfully.

And now you can test the mysql daemon with the following command 
from the myrocks wiki.

`mysql_install_db --defaults-file=/path/to/my.cnf`

and start mysqld
`mysqld_safe --defaults-file=/path/to/my.cnf`


So what's my next step.

How do I run the mysql bench ?


some bench of mysql must be compiled, let;'s find it.


I cannot run seq-bench test , the following the error .
```
MySQL Version 5.6.35
Using default engine 'rocksdb'
Using default tmp engine 'MyISAM'
Checking supported features...
 - SSL connections supported
Tests will be run in async client mode
Collecting tests...
 - adding combinations for rocksdb
Removing old var directory...
Creating var directory '/usr/local/mysql/mysql-test/var'...
mysql-test-run: *** ERROR: The destination for symlink /usr/local/mysql/mysql-test/var does not exist
```


So now I am upset.

I will switched to the rocksdb for now and plot some simple data first with db_bench and ycsb.


Try once with the following command, still failed
`mysql_install_db --defaults-file=/home/bily/my.cnf`
`mysqld_safe --defaults-file=/home/bily/my.cnf`

The mysqld stops immediately after I enter the `mysqld_safe` command.

This is weird
