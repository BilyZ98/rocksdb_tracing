I just downloaded the myrocks from github.

And I didn't do much today. 


Mainly focus on the ramp up at microsfot 
and TOEFL reading section practice.


I should do a plot on db_bench .


I just found a bug following the code from wiki of block cache tracer.

https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/wiki/Block-cache-analysis-and-simulation-tools

```

block_cache_trace_analyzer_tool: /home/bily/pm4_backup/tracing/rocksdb/tools/block_cache_analyzer/block_cache_trace_analyzer.h:72: void rocksdb::BlockAccessInfo::AddAccess(const rocksdb::BlockCacheTraceRecord&, uint64_t): Assertion `block_size == access.block_size' failed.
```
