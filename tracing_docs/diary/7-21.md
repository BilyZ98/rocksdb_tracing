Successfully run the example code from wiki of rocksdb.

I modify the cmakelist file to add build code of trace_example.

I parse the  io_trace log file and see the output of it .

Quite clear. 
The following is the output of this command 
`./io_tracer_parser -io_trace_file /tmp/binary_trace_test_example`
