`rep_->base_cache_key`


`WriteBlockAccess(access_record, key, ... )`


Blockid is uniquely identified by column familyid
,sstfile id and block_key.


How can I record these three info in `table->Remove()`

Write the cf name and sstfile id to block cache.


What is TBlocklike ? 


What is CachableEntry ?


How can I add cf name and sst to this block_holder ? 

I think this is a good place to add .
