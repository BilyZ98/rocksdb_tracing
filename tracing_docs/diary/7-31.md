I am able to start the mysql server without aborted now.

Weird thing is I didn't change anything and it works.

I start the mysql server with the following command 


`bin/mysqld_safe --defaults-file=/home/bily/my.cnf`


The problem now I meet is I can connect to  the mysql server 
with the following command.

`mysql -u root -p`


The error  is 
```
ERROR 1045 : ACCESS denied for user 'root'@'localhost' (using password: YES)
```


I googled it, tries some solution code , did not work for me now.



And I will try to run TPCH benchmark once I solve this connection problem.

And also there is still some bug in the block cache tracing code of rocksdb, I think I will spend some time figuring  it  out .
I will plot some simple data between application level tracing and IO level tracing for now.

But I don't find any options in the db_bench that controls filesystem IO level tracing, and this is a possible way to contribute some source cod e to rocksdb .

And another potential contribution would be fix the block cache tracing bug.
