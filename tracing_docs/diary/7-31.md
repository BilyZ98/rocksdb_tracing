I am able to start the mysql server without aborted now.

Weird thing is I didn't change anything and it works.

I start the mysql server with the following command 


`bin/mysqld_safe --defaults-file=/home/bily/my.cnf`


The problem now I meet is I can connect to  the mysql server 
with the following command.

`mysql -u root -p`


The error  is 
```
ERROR 1045 : ACCESS denied for user 'root'@'localhost' (using password: YES)
```


I googled it, tries some solution code , did not work for me now.
