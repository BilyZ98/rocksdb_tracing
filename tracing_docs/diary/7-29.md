Didn't do much today,

I made a lot of try and finally build the myrocks successfully. 

I follow the wiki of the build of myrocks.


The platform info
OS: ubuntu 20
Compiler: GCC 9.4.0


And then  I install the libcap-devel package.
This package is not mentioned on the build wiki .
You will get the error that `cap is not defined ` if you don't have  the  libcap-devel package in your os.


Finally I am able to build the myrocks successfully after I  
`git clean -fxd`
and 
`cmake ` again.

So now I know that some environment  variable will be read during cmake,
so by the time you call
`make -j`
the 
`#ifdef  SOME_VARIABLE` will read from the Makefile cmake write so that 
some flags will not be able to be read if you install some 
devel package like `libcap-devel` and then exe the `make -j`.
