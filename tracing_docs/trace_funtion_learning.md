# Why tracing ?
Zhichao's motivation is that he thinks that the current benchmark does not reflect the real world workload. 

The IO block access pattern that the real world workload causes is different than  what it is by ycsb or dbbench.

Motivation understood.

# The code example 
`../trace_example/trace_example.cc`



# How do I plan to learn about the tracing in rocksdb ? 
So fundamentally my strategy will be run the tests. 
- run the example code 
- test with db_bench and ycsb
- Write down the notes and doc
